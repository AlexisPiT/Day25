                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                        I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                        Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
                        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                        In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                        100% recommend! ”
